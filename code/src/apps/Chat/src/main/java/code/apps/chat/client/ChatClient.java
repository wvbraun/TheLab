/**
 * An instance of this class will act as a chat client in a chat room on
 * SERVER_PORT_NUMBER supported by the machine at serverIPAddress. It is created
 * by an instance of ChatClientView.
 * <p/>
 * This class depends on classes ChatClientView, ChatMessageReader, and
 * ChatMessageWriter.
 * <p/>
 * Special notes (for advanced readers only):
 * <p/>
 * When communicating with another computer over a network, you have to try to
 * open your output stream *before* your input stream. You can always open an
 * output stream (to try to write to the remote computer), but to open an input
 * stream (to try to read from the remote computer) the computer you're trying
 * to establish communication links with must have already opened *its* output
 * stream (so that you can read from it). Since it might be waiting on you to
 * open your output stream (so that it could open its input stream), if you both
 * try to open your input streams before your output streams, you'd both wait on
 * each forever. However, if you both open your output streams first, those
 * actions are guaranteed to work. So you are guaranteeing that by the time that
 * the remote computer gets around to opening its input stream that action will
 * work, and vice versa.
 * <p/>
 * Also, its useful to know that before any communication link can be
 * established, some sort of header information needs to be exchanged. In the
 * case of Socket object streams, the link is being established over TCP/IP and
 * the stream header contains a magic number and version number. The first thing
 * that's suppsoed to happen is that those are read from the stream and
 * verified. That action will block until the remote computer's
 * ObjectOutputStream has written that header information out and flushed its
 * buffer. So unless its ObjectOutputStream's writeObject() method is followed
 * by a flush() nothing will happen. This particular matter is taken care of for
 * you by the low-level plumbing in the custom ChatMessageWriter class, so you
 * don't need to worry about it in this particular program but it's something
 * that's good to know if you ever write other networking programs.
