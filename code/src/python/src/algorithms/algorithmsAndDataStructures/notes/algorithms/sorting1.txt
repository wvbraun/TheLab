Sorting -
	The process of placing elements from a collection in some kind
	of order. Like searching, the efficieny of a sorting algo is 
	related to the number of items being processed. For small
	collections, a complex sorting method may not be worth it. 
	On the other hand, for larger collections, we want to take
	advantages of as many improvements as possible. 

1. It is necessary to compare two values to see which is smaller
orlarger. In order to sort a collection, it will be necessary to
have some systematic way to compare values to see if they are out
of order. The total number of comparisons will be the most 
common way to measure a sort procedure. 

2. When values are not in the correct position with respect to 
one another, it may be necessary to exchange them. This exchange
is a costly operation and the total number of exchanges will be
important for evaluating the overall efficiency of the algorithm.

The Bubble Sort - 
	Makes multiple passes through a list. It compares adjacent 
	items and exchanges those that are out of order. Each pass
	through the list places the next largest value in its proper
	place. In essence, each item 'bubble' up to the location 
	where it belongs.
