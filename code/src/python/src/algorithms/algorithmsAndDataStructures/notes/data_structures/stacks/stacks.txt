A stack -
	is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new
items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the
same end. This end is commonly reffered to as the top. The end
opposite the top is known as the base. 

The base of the stack is signifcant because the items stored in the 
stack that are closer to the base represent those that have been
in the stack the longest. The most recently added item is the one
that is in the position to be removed first. This is sometimes called
LIFO (last in first out). 

---------------------------------------
The Stack Abstract Data Type

Stack() - creates a new stack that is empty. It needs no parameters
		and returns and empty stack 

push(item) - adds a new item to the top of the stack. It needs
			the item and returns nothing. 

pop() - removes the top item from the stack. It needs no parameters
		and returns the item. The stack is modified. 

peek() - returns the top item from the stack but does not remove 
		it. It needs no parameters, stack is not modified. 

isEmpty() - tests to see whether the stack is empty. It needs no
			parameters and returns a boolean value. 

size() - returns the number of items on the stack. It needs no 
		parameters and returns an integer.

Simple Stack Operations

if s is a stack that is empty:

Stack Operation |	Stack Contents	|	Return Value

s.isEmpty() 	|	[]	| True
s.push(4)		|	[4]	|	
s.push('dog')	| 	[4, 'dog']	|
s.peek()		| 	[4, 'dog']		| 'dog'
s.push(True)	|	[4, 'dog', True	|
s.size()		|	[4, 'dog', True	| 3
s.isEmpty()		|	[4, 'dog', True |	False
s.push(8.24)	|	[4, 'dog', True, 8.24	|	
s.pop()			|	[4, 'dog', True	|	8.24
s.size()		| 	[4, 'dog', True	| 3	

----------------------------------------------
Implementing a Stack 

The stack operations are implemented as methods. Python provides
an ordered collection mechanism and a set of methods. For example,
if we have the list [2,5,4,3,6], we only need to decide which
end of the list will be considered the top of the stack and which
end is the base.
