Roadmap
=======

Setuptools has merged with Distribute and to provide a unified codebase for
ongoing development.

This new effort will draw from the resources of both projects to leverage
community contribution for ongoing advancement but also maintain stability
for the user base.

An initial release of Setuptools 0.7 will attempt to be compatible both with
Setuptools 0.6c11 and Distribute 0.6.36. Where compatibility cannot be
achieved, the changes should be well-documented.
