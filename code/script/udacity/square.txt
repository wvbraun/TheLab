# Define a procedure, square, that takes one number 
# as its input, and returns the square of that 
# number (result of multiplying
# the number by itself).






# To test your procedure, uncomment the print 
# statement below, by removing the hash mark (#) 
# at the beginning of the line.

# Do not remove the # from in front of the line 
# with the arrows (>>>). Lines which begin like 
# this (#>>>) are included to show the results
# you should see when run your procedure.
