What happened today?:
I did a little bit of studying; curve sketching. I am somewhat understanding it, but I need to get a more thorough understanding. Calculus is bleh. 
I haven't updated in the past few days although I have no excuse. Some memorable things that are going on:
I am pretty sure Iman (my brothers friend who is staying with us) tried to steal my debit card information. wtf.
Also Tesla posted profitable sales!!!! That is awesome, the future is looking bright as hell. 
Elon Musk is going to release his Hyperloop project design on Monday, I am so fucking excited.
Although he has mentioned that he does not plan to build it, at least for the forseable future as he simply has too much on his plate at the moment. 
I suppose I cannot blame it, for I have yet to contribute anything of much worth to the world yet. 
Also during work while out on a delivery a mother was hitting on me and even offered hooking me and her daughter up!!! wuttt.
I was way too stoned for that, but I was quite curious and wish I would have at least seen what was to offer... 

Something to end on:
Hyperloop Design Monday!!!!!!!!
