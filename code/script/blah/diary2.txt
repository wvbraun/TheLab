What happened today?:
I studied a bit of "Learn Python the Hard Way."
I am currently creating a little adventure game, it seems like it will be quite fun. I also went through 4 lessons of Duolingo, I hope I am prepared for Spanish 3! 
I am about to go into work at 5, it will be gay but whatever. Maybe I will actually make some money today, I haven't made shit the last few days. 
I still need to get clothes and shit for school, I need to get stuff for my room.
 I am both excited and nervous, although I still think I should have gone to Purdue. Perhaps in another universe I did. 
I suppose it is just as likely that in another universe I won the lottery haha, tomorrows drawing is worth 400 million!?!? 
Ivy Tech is going to suck dick, who knows though maybe my appeal will turn out in my favor. It is doubtful. 

Something to end on:
 I am about to smoke, should I stop..?
