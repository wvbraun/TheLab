/**
 * Problem Statement
 * For an upcoming programming contest, Roy is forming some teams from the n students of his university. 
 * A team can have any number of contestants.
 * 
 * Roy knows the skill level of each contestant. To make the teams work as a unit, he should ensure that 
 * there is no skill gap between the contestants of the same team. In other words, if the skill level of a 
 * contestant is x, then he has either the lowest skill level in his team or there exists another contestant 
 * with skill level of x−1 in the same team. Also, no two contestants of the same team should have same skill 
 * level. Note that a contestant can write buggy code and thus can have a negative skill level.
 * 
 * The more contestants on the team, the more problems they can attempt at a time. So, Roy wants to form 
 * teams such that the smallest team is as large as possible.
 * 
 * Input Format
 * The first line of input contains t (1≤t≤100), the number of test cases.
 * Each case contains an integer n (0≤n≤105), the number of contestants, followed by n space separated integers. 
 * The ith integer denotes the skill level of ith contestant. The absolute values of skill levels will not exceed 
 * 109.
 * The total number of contestants in all cases will not exceed 106.
 * 
 * Output Format
 * For each test case, print the size of smallest team in a separate line.
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 4  
 * 7 4 5 2 3 -4 -3 -5  
 * 1 -4  
 * 4 3 2 3 1  
 * 7 1 -2 -3 -4 2 0 -1  
 * 
 * Sample Output
 * 3
 * 1
 * 1
 * 7
