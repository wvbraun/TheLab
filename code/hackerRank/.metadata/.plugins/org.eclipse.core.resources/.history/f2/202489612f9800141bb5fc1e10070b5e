/**
 * Problem Statement
 * 
 * Sorting 
 * One common task for computers is to sort data. For example, people might 
 * want to see all their files on a computer sorted by size. Since sorting is 
 * a simple problem with many different possible solutions, it is often used 
 * to introduce the study of algorithms.
 * 
 * Insertion Sort 
 * These challenges will cover Insertion Sort, a simple and intuitive sorting 
 * algorithm. We will first start with an already sorted list.
 * 
 * Insert element into sorted list 
 * Given a sorted list with an unsorted number V in the right-most cell, 
 * can you write some simple code to insert V into the array so it remains sorted?
 * Print the array every time a value is shifted in the array until the array is 
 * fully sorted. The goal of this challenge is to follow the correct order of 
 * insertion sort.
 * 
 * Guideline: You can copy the value of V to a variable, and consider its cell 
 * "empty". Since this leaves an extra cell empty on the right, you can shift 
 * everything over until V can be inserted. This will create a duplicate of each 
 * value, but when you reach the right spot, you can replace a value with V.
 * 
 * Input Format 
 * There will be two lines of input:
 * 	s - the size of the array
 * 	ar - the sorted array of integers
 * 
 * Output Format 
 * On each line, output the entire array every time an item is shifted in it.
 * 
 * Constraints 
 * 1<=s<=1000 
 * -10000<=x<= 10000, x âˆˆ ar
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 5
 * 2 4 6 8 3
 *
 * Sample Output
 * 2 4 6 8 8 
 * 2 4 6 6 8 
 * 2 4 4 6 8 
 * 2 3 4 6 8
