/**
 * Problem Statement
 * Calvin is driving his favorite vehicle on the 101 freeway. He notices that 
 * the check engine light of his vehicle is on, and he wants to service it immediately 
 * to avoid any risks. Luckily, a service lane runs parallel to the highway. The length 
 * of the highway and the service lane is N units. The service lane consists of N segments
 * of unit length, where each segment can have different widths.
 * Calvin can enter into and exit from any segment. Let's call the entry segment as 
 * index i and the exit segment as index j. Assume that the exit segment lies after 
 * the entry segment(j>i) and i ≥ 0. Calvin has to pass through all segments from index i 
 * to index j (both inclusive).
 * 
 * Calvin has three types of vehicles - bike, car and truck, represented by 1, 2 and 3 
 * respectively. These numbers also denote the width of the vehicle. We are given an 
 * array width[] of length N, where width[k] represents the width of kth segment of our 
 * service lane. It is guaranteed that while servicing he can pass through at most 1000 
 * segments, including entry and exit segments.
 * 
 * If width[k] is 1, only the bike can pass through kth segment.
 * 
 * If width[k] is 2, the bike and car can pass through kth segment.
 * 
 * If width[k] is 3, any of the bike, car or truck can pass through kth segment.
 * 
 * Given the entry and exit point of Calvin's vehicle in the service lane, output 
 * the type of largest vehicle which can pass through the service lane (including the 
 * entry & exit segment)
 * 
 * Input Format 
 * The first line of input contains two integers - N & T, where N is the length of 
 * the freeway, and T is the number of test cases. The next line has N space-separated 
 * integers which represents the width array.
 * T test cases follow. Each test case contains two integers - i & j, where i is the 
 * index of segment through which Calvin enters the service lane and j is the index of 
 * the lane segment where he exits.
 * 
 * Output Format 
 * For each test case, print the number that represents the largest vehicle type that 
 * can pass through the service lane.
 * 
 * Note 
 * Calvin has to pass through all segments from index i to indexj (both inclusive).
 * 
 * Constraints 
 * 2 <= N <= 100000 
 * 1 <= T <= 1000 
 * 0 <= i < j < N 
 * 2 <= j-i+1 <= min(N,1000) 
 * 1 <= width[k] <= 3, where 0 <= k < N
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 8 5
 * 2 3 1 2 3 2 3 3
 * 0 3
 * 4 6
 * 6 7
 * 3 5
 * 0 7
 * 
 * Sample Output
 * 1
 * 2
 * 3
 * 2
 * 1
