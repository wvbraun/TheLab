/**
 * Problem Statement
 * Sunny and Johnny together have M dollars and want to spend the amount at an 
 * ice cream parlour. The parlour offers N flavors, and they want to choose 2 
 * flavors so that they end up spending the whole amount.
 * 
 * You are given a list of cost of these N flavors. The cost of ith flavor is 
 * denoted by (ci). You have to display the indices of two flavors whose sum is M.
 * 
 * Input Format
 * The first line of the input contains T, T test cases follow. 
 * Each test case follows the format: The first line contains M. 
 * The second line contains N. The third line contains N single space separated 
 * integers denoting the price of each flavor. Here, ith integer denotes ci.
 * 
 * Output Format
 * Output two integers, each of which is a valid index of the flavor. 
 * The lower index must be printed first. Indices are indexed from 1 to N.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 1 ≤ T ≤ 50 
 * 2 ≤ M ≤ 10000 
 * 2 ≤ N ≤ 10000 
 * 1 ≤ ci ≤ 10000 
 * 
 * The prices of two items may be same and each test case has a unique solution.
 *
