/**
 * Problem Statement
 * Watson gives an array A1,A2...AN to Sherlock. Then he asks him to find if there
 * exists an element in the array, such that, the sum of elements on its left is 
 * equal to the sum of elements on its right. If there are no elements to left/right, 
 * then sum is considered to be zero.
 * Formally, find an i, such that, A1+A2...Ai-1 = Ai+1+Ai+2...AN.
 * 
 * Input Format 
 * The first line contains T, the number of test cases. For each test case, the first 
 * line contains N, the number of elements in the array A. The second line for each 
 * testcase contains N space separated integers, denoting the array A.
 * 
 * Output Format
 * For each test case, print YES if there exists an element in the array, such that, 
 * the sum of elements on its left is equal to the sum of elements on its right, else 
 * print NO.
 * 
 * Constraints 
 * 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 
 * 1 ≤ N ≤ 105 
 * 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 2*104 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 2
 * 3
 * 1 2 3
 * 4
 * 1 2 3 3
 * 
 * Sample Output
 * NO
 * YES
