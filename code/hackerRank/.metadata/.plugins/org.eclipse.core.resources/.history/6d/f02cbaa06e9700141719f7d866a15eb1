/**
 * Cut The Sticks
 * 
 * Problem Statement
 * You are given N sticks, where each stick is of positive integral length.
 * A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced 
 * by the length of the smallest stick.
 * 
 * Suppose we have 6 sticks of length: 5 4 4 2 2 8
 * then in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the 6 sticks. 
 * For next cut operation 4 sticks are left (of non-zero length), 
 * whose length are: 3 2 2 6
 * 
 * Above step is repeated till no sticks are left.
 * Given length of N sticks, print the number of sticks that are cut in subsequent 
 * cut operations.
 * 
 * Input Format 
 * The first line contains a single integer N. 
 * The next line contains N integers: a0, a1,...aN-1 separated by space, where 
 * ai represents the length of ith stick.
 * 
 * Output Format 
 * For each operation, print the number of sticks that are cut in separate line.
 * 
 * Constraints 
 * 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 
 * 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 6
 * 5 4 4 2 2 8
 * 
 * Sample Output
 * 6
 * 4
 * 2
 * 1
