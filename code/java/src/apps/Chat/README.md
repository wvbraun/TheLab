# Chat

This is a project which allows users to create a server in which clients can connect to it 
and chat; just a simple chat client+server.

# How to Use

The client is currently running on localhost, this can be changed to any server. To do this, simply
edit the ChatClientView HOST_NAME.

```
Client:
	java -jar Client.jar
	
Server:
	java -jar Server.jar
```
