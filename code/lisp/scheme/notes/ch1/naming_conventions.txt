Scheme's naming conventions are designed to provide a 
high degree of regularity:

	- Predicate names end in a question mark (?). Predicates are 
	procedures that return a true or false answer such as 
	eg?, zero?, and string=?. The common numeric comparators 
	=, <,>,<=,and >= are execeptions to this. 

	- Type predicates, such as pair?, are created from the name of 
	the type, in this case pair, and the question mark. 

	- The names of most character, string, and vector procedures start
	with the prefix, char-, string-, and vector-. 
	ex: string-append 

	- The names of procedures that convert an object of one type into
	an object of another type are written as type1->type2
	ex: vector->list

	- The names of procedures and syntactic forms that cause side 
	effects end with an exclamation point (!). These include set! and
	vector-set!. Procedures that perfrom input or output technically
	cause side effects, but their names are execeptions to this rule.
