Enumerations are special sets of named values which all 
maps to a set of numbers, usually integers. They come 
in handy when you wish to be able to choose between a 
set of constant values, and with each possible value
relating to a number, they can be used in a wide range of
situations. 

Enumerations are defined above classes, inside our namespace.
This means we can use enumerations from all classes within 
the same namespace. 

Here is a simple enumeration:

public enum Days { Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday}

All of these possible values correspond to a number. If we do
not set them specifically, the first value is equal to 0, the
next one to 1, and so on. 

We can change this though, like this:

public enum Days { Monday = 1, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday}

Then all subsequent values will be 1 higher

Another cool feature of enumerations is the fact that you can
have a string representation of the values as well.
