The struct is a lightweight alternative to a class. It can
do nearly the same thing as a class, but it is less
expensive to use. 

New instances of a class are placed on the heap, where new
instances of a struct are placed on the stack. You are also
not dealing with references to structs, like with classes, 
but instead you are working directly with the struct instance.
This also means that when you pass a struct to a function, 
it is by value, instead of as a reference. 

You should use structs when you wish to represent more 
simple data structures, espcially if you know you will be
instantiaing many of them. 


Fields cannot have initializers, meaning that you cannot
declare a member like this:

	private string color = "Blue";

If you declare a constructor, all fields must be assigned to
before leaving the constructor. A struct does come with a 
default constructor, but as soon as you choose to define your
own, you must initalize all fields in it. 
That also means that you cannot declare your own parameterless
constructrs - all struct constructs must have at least one 
parameter. 

A struct cannot inherit from other classes or structs, and 
classes cannot inherit form structs.
