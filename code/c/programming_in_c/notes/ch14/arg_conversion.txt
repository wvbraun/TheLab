The complier makes assumptions about argument types. In the
absenceof info about the argument types to a function, the
complier automatically converts _Bool, char, or short args 
to ints and converts float args to double. 

ex:

float x;
	...
y = absoluteValue (x);

Having not seen the defintion of absoluteValue, the complier
converts the float (x) to double and passes the result to the
function. 

if the absoluteValue func is defined inside another source
file like this:

float absoluteValue (float x) {

	if (x < 0.0)
		x = -x;

	return x;
}

Bad!!! First, the function returns a float, yet the complier
thinks it is an int. Seecond, the function expects to see 
a float argument, but the complier will pass a double.
