Whenever a signed int or signed short int is converted into 
an integer of a larger size, the sign is extended to the left
when the conversion is performed. This ensures that 
a short int have a value of -5, will also have the the value 
of -5 when converted to a long int. 

Whenever an unsigned int is converted to an int of larger 
size, no sign extension occus.
