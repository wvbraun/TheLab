Suppose you define a structure:

struct entry {

	int value;
	struct entry *next;
};

This defines a structure called entry, which contains 2 members.
The first, an integer named value. 
The second, a member named next, which is a pointer to an entry
structure. 
----------

Suppose you define 2 variables to be of type struct entry:

struct entry n1, n2;

You set the next pointer of struct n1 to point to structure n2
by executing:
n1.next = &n2;

This statement makes a link between n1 and n2
