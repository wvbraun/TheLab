The c pre processor is a template processing system.
 Traditionally people just used the CPP to store constants
 and make macros.
 However, cpp can be used as a code generated to create
 templated pieces of code. 

The cpp works by giving you a file, usually a .c file. 
It then processes various bits of tet with the # character. 
When it encounters one of these it performs a specific 
replacement on the text of the input file. 
The main advanatge is that it can include other files, 
and then aguments its list of macros based on the files contents.
