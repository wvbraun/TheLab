C functions may be used recursively; that is, a function
may call itself either directly or indirectly.

Consider printer a number as a character string, the digits
are generated in the wrong order: low-order digits are 
available before high order digits, but they must be 
printed the other way around. 

2 solutions to this:

1. store the digits in an array as they are generated, 
then print them in reserve order. 
2. use recursion in which printd first calls itself to 
cope with any leading digits, then prints the trailing 
digit.
