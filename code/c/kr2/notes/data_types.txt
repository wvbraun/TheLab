Signed vs Unsigned:
 - A signed integer variable can contain a numerical data value within the range -32768 to 32767

 - An unsigned integer variable can contain a numerical data value within the range of 0 to 65535

Basic Types:

char: smallest addressable unit of the machine that can contain basic character set. It is an integer type. 
	- signed char 
	- unsigned char 

-----
short 			|   short signed integer type, at least 16 bits
short int 		|   in size. 
signed short 		|
signed short int 	|

	- unsigned short 
	- unsigned short int 

-----
int 	   |	Basic signed integer type, at least 16 bits. 
signed int |

unsigned 
unsigned int 

-----
long 			| long singed integer, at least 32 bits. 
long int 		|
signed long 		|
signed long int 	|

unsigned long 
unsigned long int 

-----
long long 		| long long signed integer, at least 64 bits. 
long long int 		|
signed long long 	|
signed long long int    |

unsigned long long 
unsigned long long int 

-----
float:
	Signle precision floating point type. 

-----
double:
	double precesion floating point type 

----
long double:
	extended precision floating-point type 

--------------------------------------------------------------

int ex: 1234 
long int ex: 1234L or 1234l
unsigned long int ex: 1234UL or 1234ul

---
float ex: 123.4f or 123.4F
double ex: 123.4l or 123.4L

----

the characther constant '\0' represents the character with zero value.
