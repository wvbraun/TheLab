A pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable. 

----------------------

int x = 1, y = 2, z[10];
int *ip; // ip is a pointer to int 

ip = &x; // ip now points to x
y = *ip // y is now 1 (bc ip points to x, x = 1)
*ip = 0; // x is now 0
ip = &z[0]; // ip now points to z[0]

-----
ex:
double *dp, atof(char *);

*dp and atof have valuses of type double, and that the argument
of atof is a pointer to char.

Pointer arguments enable a function to access and change objects 
in the function that called it. 
Consier a function getint that breaks a stream of characters 
into integer vaules, one integer per call. getint has to return 
the value it found and also signal end of file when there is no 
more input. 

the following loop fills an array with integers by calls to getint:

int n, array[SIZE], getint(int *);

for (n = 0; n < SIZE && getint(&array[n]) != EOF; n++)

// each call sets array[n] to the next integer found in the 
input and increments n.
