Type cast:

ex: 

average = (float) total / n;

the value of the variable total is converted to type float 
before the operationis performed. 

---------------------------------------------------------
The C complier adheres to strict rules when it comes to 
evaluating expressions that consist of different data types. 

1. If either operand is of type long double, the other is 
converted to long double, and the is the type of the result. 

2. If either operand is of type double, the other is converted
to double. 

3. If either operand is of type float, the other is converted
to float. 

4. If either operand is of type _Bool, char, short int, 
bit field, or an enum, it is converted to int. 

5. If either operand is of type long long int, the other is 
converted to long long int. 

6. If either operand is of type long int, the other is 
converted to long int. 

7. If this step is reached, both operands are of type int. 

------
Ex: f is a float, i an in, l a long int, s a short int. 

f * i + l / s

f*i, from step 3, because f is a float, the other operand i is
also converted into a float. 

l / s, from step 4, since s in a short int, it is converted 
converted to int. 

l / s, from step 6, since l is a long int, s is converted to
long int. 

step 3, (f*i) - float + (l / s) - long int, since (f*i) is 
of type float, (l / s) is converted to float.
