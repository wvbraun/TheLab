One of the primary uses of the #define statement is to assign symbolic names to program constants. 

----
The preprocessor statement 
#define YES 1 

defines the name YES and makes it equal to 1. The name YES
can then be used anywhere in the program where 1 could
be used. for example:

gameOver = YES; 
this assigns the value of YES to gameOver.

-----

#define NO 0 
defines the name NO and makes it equal to 0. 

-------------------
Just about the only place you cannot use a defined name
is inside a character string. So the statement:

char *charPtr = "YES"; 
sets charPtr pointing to the string "YES" and not to the 
string "1". 

--------------------
A defined name is not a variable, therefore you cannot
assign a value to it, unless the result of subsituting the
defined value is in fact a variable.
