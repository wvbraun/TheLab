A list comprehension provides a compact way of mapping a list
into another list by applying a function to each of the elements 
of the list. 

>>> a_list = [1, 9, 8, 4]
>>> [elem * 2 for elem in a_list] [2, 18, 16, 8]
>>> a_list [1, 9, 8, 4]
>>> a_list = [elem * 2 for elem in a_list]
>>> a_list [2, 18, 16, 8]
