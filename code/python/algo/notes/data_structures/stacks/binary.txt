Converting Decimal Numbers to Binary Numbers:

algorithm called 'divide by 2' uses a stack to keep track of 
the digits, easily converts int values into binary numbers. 

It assumes we start with an int greater than 0. A simple iteration
then continually divides the decimal number by 2 and keeps track
of the remainder. 
The first division gives info as to whether the value is even or odd. 
An even value will have remainder 0.

convert 232 to binary:

233 / 2 = 116, rem = 1
116 / 2 = 58, rem = 0
58 / 2 = 29, rem = 0
29 / 2 = 14, rem = 1 
14 / 2 = 7, rem = 0
7 / 2 = 3, rem = 1
3 / 2 = 1, rem = 1, 
1 / 2 = 0, rem = 1

= 10010111
