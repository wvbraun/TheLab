``distutils`` --- Building and installing Python modules
********************************************************

The ``distutils`` package provides support for building and installing
additional modules into a Python installation.  The new modules may be
either 100%-pure Python, or may be extension modules written in C, or
may be collections of Python packages which include modules coded in
both Python and C.

User documentation and API reference are provided in another document:

      The manual for developers and packagers of Python modules.  This
      describes how to prepare ``distutils``-based packages so that
      they may be easily installed into an existing Python
      installation.  It also contains instructions for end-users
      wanting to install a distutils-based package, *Installing Python
      Modules*.
