Arrays work as collections of items. You can use them to 
gather items in a single group, and perfrom various operations 
on them. 

Arrays are declared like:

	string[] names;
	int[] nums;

You need to instantiate the array to use it:

	string[] names = new string[2];

	The number (2) is the size of the array.

Putting items into the array is done like:

	names[0] = "John";
