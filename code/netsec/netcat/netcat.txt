You can use netcat to open up TCP and UDP connections between two machines over any port. 
It can also be used as a port scanning tool, similar to nmap. In addition, it can be used
for port forwarding, proxying, simple web server, and leaving an open backdoor for hacker.

Using NetCat

1. Open NetCat
	
	# nc -h

	To connect to another machineL
	# nc options host IP address port

	To listen for inbound connections:
	# nc -l -p port

2. Use NetCat to connect to remote system

	# nc 192.168.1.105 80

	Then you could type:
	HEAD / HTTP/1.0 
	and it would return the web servers banner
